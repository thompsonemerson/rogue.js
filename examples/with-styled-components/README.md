# With Razzle Example

## How to use

Download the example [or clone the whole project](https://github.com/alidcastano/rogue.js.git):

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/alidcastano/rogue.js/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 rogue.js-master/examples/with-razzle
cd with-razzle
```

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Idea behind the example

This example is to show how rogue.js plays nicely with another build system (not just parcel).

You can use it on your existing webpack project.
